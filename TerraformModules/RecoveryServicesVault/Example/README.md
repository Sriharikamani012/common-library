# Create Recovery Services Vaults in Azure
This Module allows you to create and manage one or multiple Recovery Services Vaults in Microsoft Azure.

## Features
This module will:

- Create one or muliple Recovery Services Vaults in Microsoft Azure.
- Create one or muliple Azure VM Backup Policy.

## Usage
```hcl
module "RecoveryServicesVault" {
  source                   = "../../common-library/TerraformModules/RecoveryServicesVault"
  resource_group_name      = module.BaseInfrastructure.resource_group_name
  rv_additional_tags       = var.additional_tags
  recovery_services_vaults = var.recovery_services_vaults
}
```

## Example 
Please refer Example directory to consume this module into your application.

- [main.tf](./main.tf) file calls the resource group module.
- [var.tf](./var.tf) contains declaration of terraform variables which are passed to the resource group module.
- [values.auto.tfvars](./values.auto.tfvars) contains the variable defination or actual values for respective variables which are passed to the resource group module.

## Best practices for variable declaration/defination
- All names of the Resources should be defined as per AT&T standard naming conventions.

- While declaring variables with data type 'map(object)' or 'object; or 'list(object)', It's mandatory to define all the attributes in object. If you don't want to set any attribute then define its value as null or empty list([]) or empty map({}) as per the object data type.

- Please make sure all the Required paramaters are set. Refer below section to understand the required and optional input values when using this module.

- Please verify that the values provided to the variables are in comfort with the allowed values for that variable. Refer below section to understand the allowed values for each variable when using this module.

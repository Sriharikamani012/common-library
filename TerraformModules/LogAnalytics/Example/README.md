# Create Log Analytics Workspace in Azure
This Module allows you to create log analytics workspace in azure.

## Features
- create log analytics workspace in a particular resource group

## usage
```hcl
module "LogAnalytics" {
  # validate the source path before executing the module.   
  source              = "../../common-library/TerraformModules/LogAnalytics"
  resource_group_name = var.resource_group_name
  name                = var.name
  sku                 = var.sku              
  retention_in_days   = var.retention_in_days 
  law_additional_tags = var.tags
}
```

## Example 
Please refer Example directory to consume this module into your application.

- [main.tf](./main.tf) file calls the Log analytics module.
- [var.tf](./var.tf) contains declaration of terraform variables which are passed to the Log analytics module.
- [values.auto.tfvars](./values.auto.tfvars) contains the variable defination or actual values for respective variables which are passed to the Log analytics module.

## Best practices for variable declarations

1.  All names of the Resources should be defined as per AT&T standard naming     conventions.
2.  While declaring variables with data type  'map(object)'. It's mandatory      to define all the objects.If you don't want to use any specific              objects define it as null or empty list as per the object data type.
    
     - for example:
     ```hcl
      variable "example" {
      type = map(object({
      name         = string 
      permissions  = list(string) 
      cmk_enable   = bool 
      auto_scaling = string 
      })) 
     ```
      
     - In above example, if you don't want to use the objects permissions and auto_scaling, you can define it as below.
     ```hcl
       example = {
          name = "example"
          permissions = []
          auto_scaling = null
          }
    ```       
3.  Please make sure all the Required paramaters are declared.Refer below 
    section to understand the required and optional paramters of this module. 

4. Please verify that the values provided to the variables are with in the      allowed values.Refer below section to understand the allowed values to       each paramter.
